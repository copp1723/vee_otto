# Fixes Applied Report

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Feature Extraction - FIXED**
**Problem**: Features like "6.7L I-6 Diesel" were being split on commas
**Solution**: Removed comma from delimiters in `WindowStickerService.ts` line 117
**Result**: 
- âœ… "6.7L I-6 Diesel Turbocharged" now extracted correctly
- âœ… "Auto-Dimming Rearview Mirror" no longer split
- âœ… 33 features extracted (up from 30)

### 2. **Missing Feature Mappings - FIXED**
**Problem**: Common features had no checkbox mappings
**Solution**: Added mappings in `VAutoCheckboxMappingService.ts` lines 46-54
**Result**:
- âœ… "Bluetooth Connectivity" â†’ "Bluetooth" 
- âœ… "Power Windows" â†’ "Power Windows"
- âœ… "Front/Side Airbags" â†’ "Airbags"
- âœ… 16 checkboxes mapped (up from 11)

## ðŸ“Š Current Performance

### Before Fixes:
- Features Extracted: 30 (many split incorrectly)
- Checkboxes Mapped: 11
- Success Rate: ~37%

### After Fixes:
- Features Extracted: 33 (correctly parsed)
- Checkboxes Mapped: 16
- Success Rate: ~48%
- State Changes: 13 checkboxes would be updated

## ðŸ”§ Additional Mappings Recommended

To improve from 48% to 70%+ success rate, add these mappings:

```typescript
// Engine-specific mappings
mapping.set('6.7L I-6 Diesel Turbocharged', ['Diesel Engine', 'Turbocharged Engine', '6.7L Engine']);
mapping.set('6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel', ['Diesel Engine', 'Cummins Engine', '6.7L Engine']);
mapping.set('Heavy Duty Transmission', ['Heavy Duty Trans', 'HD Transmission']);
mapping.set('Engine Block Heater', ['Block Heater', 'Engine Heater']);

// Seat mappings
mapping.set('Power Driver Seat', ['Power Seats', 'Power Driver Seat', 'Power Front Seats']);
mapping.set('Heated Front Seats', ['Heated Seats', 'Heated Front Seats']);
```

## âœ… Ready for Testing

The MVP is now ready for full end-to-end testing with the fixes applied:

```bash
# Test with fixed parsing
VAUTO_USERNAME="Jcopp" VAUTO_PASSWORD="htu9QMD-wtkjpt6qak" \
HEADLESS=false MAX_VEHICLES=1 SLOW_MO=2000 \
npx ts-node scripts/run-mvp-end-to-end.ts
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results

With the fixes applied, you should see:
- âœ… Better feature extraction (no split features)
- âœ… More successful checkbox mappings
- âœ… Higher accuracy in checkbox updates
- âœ… Cleaner JSON reports

## ðŸš¨ Features That Won't Map

These features typically don't have corresponding checkboxes:
- "Color-keyed instrument panel bezel" (cosmetic detail)
- Specific color names
- Trim-specific details
- Part numbers

This is normal and expected - focus on the functional features that do have checkboxes.
