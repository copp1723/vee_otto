# VAuto Automation - 2FA & Saved Filters Solution

## ✅ RESOLVED: 2FA Authentication Issue

### Problem
- Automation was polling `http://localhost:3000/api/2fa/latest` instead of Render deployment
- Shell script was overriding `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable

### Solution
1. **Fixed Shell Script** - Modified `scripts/run-vauto-automation.sh` to respect `.env` settings:
   ```bash
   # Don't override PUBLIC_URL if it's already set in .env
   if [ -z "$PUBLIC_URL" ]; then
       export PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
   fi
   ```

2. **Fixed Webhook Signature Validation** - Added Render-specific handling in `src/server.ts`:
   - Detects Render environment
   - Uses fixed URL for signature validation
   - Added comprehensive logging

### Result
✅ **2FA now works completely automated:**
- Login with username/password
- Select phone 2FA method
- SMS sent to Twilio
- Webhook receives code on Render
- Automation retrieves code and enters it
- Successfully logs into VAuto

## 🔧 IN PROGRESS: Saved Filters Dropdown Issue

### Problem
- Automation clicks "Saved Filters" button successfully
- But finds 0 dropdown items (expecting "RECENT INVENTORY")
- Falls back to manual filter which also fails

### Improvements Made
1. **Enhanced Dropdown Detection** - Added multiple selector strategies:
   ```javascript
   // Try various ExtJS dropdown selectors
   '//div[contains(@class, "x-layer")]//div[contains(@class, "x-combo-list-inner")]/div'
   '//div[@class="x-combo-list-inner"]/div'
   '//ul[contains(@class, "x-menu-list")]//li'
   ```

2. **Added Wait Times** - Dropdown needs time to render after click

3. **JavaScript Evaluation Fallback** - Direct DOM manipulation if selectors fail

### Next Steps
1. **Run Test Script** to diagnose dropdown structure:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node test-saved-filters-fix.ts
   ```

2. **Alternative Approach** - If saved filters continue to fail:
   - Use manual age filter (0-1 days)
   - Or implement direct navigation to filtered URL

## 📊 Current Automation Status

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Login | ✅ Working | Username/password entry |
| 2FA | ✅ Fixed | Webhook integration complete |
| Navigate to Inventory | ✅ Working | Page loads successfully |
| Click Saved Filters | ✅ Working | Button found and clicked |
| Select Recent Inventory | ❌ In Progress | Dropdown items not found |
| Process Vehicles | ⏳ Pending | Blocked by filter issue |

## 🚀 Complete Workflow Goal

Once filters are working, the automation will:
1. Filter to new vehicles (0-1 days old)
2. Open each vehicle's Factory Equipment tab
3. Read window sticker content
4. Extract features (Bluetooth, Sunroof, etc.)
5. Update checkboxes based on actual features
6. Save changes
7. Generate completion report

## 🛠️ Commands

```bash
# Run full automation
npm run vauto:auto

# Test saved filters fix
npx ts-node test-saved-filters-fix.ts

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/vinny-agent.log | grep -i "filter"

# Check 2FA webhook status
curl https://vee-otto-api.onrender.com/api/2fa/test | jq
```
