## 2025-07-16: Major Workflow Enhancements & Error-Handled Reporting

### Key Updates Completed

- **Per-Vehicle Factory Equipment Extraction:**  
  The workflow now opens the Factory Equipment tab and extracts window sticker information for every vehicle processed, as required by the end-to-end flow. This ensures that feature mapping and checkbox updates are always based on the latest sticker data.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  All Playwright actions in vehicle processing are now wrapped with `ErrorHandlingService.executeWithErrorHandling` or `reliableClick`. If any step fails after all retries, the vehicle is marked as SKIPPED, the error is logged, and the workflow continues to the next vehicle.

- **Structured Error Logging:**  
  Errors encountered during vehicle processing are logged in detail in the `VehicleProcessingResult` and are included in both the main report and a dedicated `errors.csv` file.

- **Per-Dealership Reporting:**  
  Reports are generated per dealership, with isolation of data and filenames for each run. Each report includes VIN, features updated, unmapped features, and all errors.

- **Automated Email Delivery:**  
  After each run, the system sends an email with both the main CSV and the new `errors.csv` attached to the configured recipients.

- **Smoke-Tested End-to-End:**  
  The workflow was run with a small inventory and a forced failure. Vehicles that failed were skipped, errors were logged in both CSV/JSON, and the report email was sent with both attachments.

### Next Steps

- Review the generated CSVs and email attachments for accuracy.
- Continue to refine error categorization and reporting as new edge cases are discovered.
- Expand the feature mapping dictionary and error recovery strategies as needed.
