## 2025-07-17 - Debugging "Factory Equipment" Tab Click

**Status:** Unblocked

**Issue:**
The `enhanced-process-vehicles` task consistently fails at the step where it needs to click the "Factory Equipment" tab. This prevents the window sticker from being accessed, which blocks the entire feature extraction and checkbox mapping workflow.

**Findings:**
- The initial implementation used a series of fallback selectors which were not reliably finding or clicking the button.
- The user provided the exact selector for the button, which is `id="ext-gen199"`. This was confirmed to work via browser developer tools.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Prioritize Correct Selector:** Update `EnhancedVehicleProcessingTask.ts` to use the high-confidence selector (`#ext-gen199`) as the primary method for locating the "Factory Equipment" button.
2.  **Add Robustness Checks:** Implement explicit checks to ensure the button is visible and enabled before attempting to click it.
3.  **Enhance Logging:** Add detailed logging before and after the click attempt to capture the button's state (visible, enabled, outerHTML) for easier debugging in case of future failures.
4.  **Implement Fallback Click:** Add a direct `page.click()` as a secondary strategy if the initial `reliableClick` utility fails with the new selector.

This targeted approach should resolve the immediate blocker and make the process more resilient.
