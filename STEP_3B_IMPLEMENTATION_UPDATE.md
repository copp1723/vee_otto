# vAuto Step 3B Implementation Update

## Alignment with Workflow Specifications

Based on the provided workflow documentation, I've updated the implementation to specifically match Step 3B requirements:

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. **IFrame Context Handling**
- Added proper handling for `GaugePageIFrame` (id=GaugePageIFrame)
- Attempts to select iframe before clicking Factory Equipment tab
- Falls back to direct page interaction if iframe not present

```typescript
// Select the GaugePageIFrame as per workflow
factoryFrame = page.frameLocator('#GaugePageIFrame');
await factoryFrame.locator('body').waitFor({ timeout: 3000 });
```

#### 2. **Factory Equipment Tab Navigation**
- Prioritized the specific ID from workflow: `id=ext-gen201`
- Multiple fallback strategies if primary selector fails
- Handles both iframe and non-iframe contexts

```typescript
// Strategy 1: Try within iframe with workflow-specified ID
await factoryFrame.locator('#ext-gen201').click();

// Strategy 2: Direct page click with workflow ID
await reliableClick(page, '#ext-gen201', 'Factory Equipment Tab');
```

#### 3. **Window Title Detection**
- Properly checks for `title=factory-equipment-details` window
- Iterates through all browser windows to find the correct one
- Switches context when factory equipment window is found

```typescript
const title = await p.title();
if (title === 'factory-equipment-details' || title.includes('factory-equipment')) {
    factoryWindow = p;
    page = factoryWindow;
}
```

#### 4. **Window Sticker Content Extraction**
- Updated to look for HTML content (not PDF) as specified
- Primary selector: `xpath=//div[contains(@class, 'window-sticker-details')]`
- Extracts embedded HTML content with sections like "Interior," "Mechanical," "Comfort & Convenience"

```typescript
// Primary selector from workflow
'//div[contains(@class, "window-sticker-details")]'
```

#### 5. **Feature Extraction**
- Parses content by sections (Interior, Mechanical, Comfort & Convenience)
- Extracts individual features from each section
- Handles various formatting (bullets, newlines, commas)

```typescript
const sections = {
    interior: /Interior[:\s]*([\s\S]*?)(?=\n\s*(?:Mechanical|Comfort|Safety|Exterior|$))/i,
    mechanical: /Mechanical[:\s]*([\s\S]*?)(?=\n\s*(?:Interior|Comfort|Safety|Exterior|$))/i,
    comfort: /(?:Comfort\s*&\s*Convenience|Convenience)[:\s]*([\s\S]*?)(?=\n\s*(?:Interior|Mechanical|Safety|Exterior|$))/i
};
```

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (Step 3B Requirements):
1. Navigate to Vehicle Info page for each vehicle
2. Select GaugePageIFrame
3. Click Factory Equipment tab (id=ext-gen201)
4. Switch to factory-equipment-details window
5. Look for View Window Sticker button
6. Extract window sticker HTML content
7. Parse features from sections (Interior, Mechanical, etc.)

### 📝 TODO (Next Steps - Step 4):
1. Map extracted features to Factory Equipment checkboxes
2. Use fuzzy matching (>90% similarity) for feature mapping
3. Update checkboxes (check if present, uncheck if absent)
4. Click Save button to confirm updates
5. Log unmapped features for dictionary updates

## Testing the Updated Implementation

### Run with Debug Mode:
```bash
# Test with visible browser and detailed logging
./scripts/run-vauto-debug.sh
```

### What to Verify:
1. **IFrame Selection**: Check logs for "Successfully selected GaugePageIFrame"
2. **Tab Navigation**: Verify "Successfully navigated to Factory Equipment tab"
3. **Window Detection**: Look for "Found factory-equipment-details window!"
4. **Content Extraction**: Confirm "Successfully extracted window sticker content"
5. **Feature Parsing**: Check "Extracted X features from window sticker"

### Expected Log Output:
```
📋 On Vehicle Info page, preparing to access Factory Equipment...
🖼️ Selecting GaugePageIFrame...
✅ Successfully selected GaugePageIFrame
🛢 Navigating to Factory Equipment tab...
✅ Successfully navigated to Factory Equipment tab
🪟 Checking for factory-equipment-details window...
✅ Found factory-equipment-details window!
📄 Extracting window sticker content...
✅ Successfully extracted window sticker content (2345 characters)
🔍 Extracted 25 features from window sticker
Features found: Adjustable Pedals, Auto-Dimming Rearview Mirror, Power Steering, 6.7L I-6 Diesel Turbocharged, Heated Front Seats...
```

## Key Implementation Notes:

1. **No PDF Processing**: The workflow specifies HTML content extraction, not PDF
2. **Inline Content**: Window sticker details are embedded in the page HTML
3. **Section-Based Parsing**: Content is organized by sections (Interior, Mechanical, etc.)
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks at each step to handle UI variations
5. **Context Switching**: Properly handles window/iframe context changes

## Next Development Phase:

Once Step 3B is working reliably, the next phase involves:
1. Implementing the feature-to-checkbox mapping dictionary
2. Adding fuzzy matching logic (using the imported fuzzball library)
3. Implementing checkbox state detection and updates
4. Adding the save functionality
5. Creating the error logging for unmapped features

The infrastructure is now in place to properly navigate to and extract window sticker content according to the workflow specifications.
